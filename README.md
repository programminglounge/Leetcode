<a id = "problem1488"> 1488. Avoid Flood in The City (Medium)</a> <br><br>

Your country has an infinite number of lakes. Initially, all the lakes are empty, but when it rains over the nth lake, the nth lake becomes full of water. If it rains over a lake that is full of water, there will be a <b>flood</b>. Your goal is to avoid floods in any lake. <br>

Given an integer array rains where: <br><ul>
  <li>rains[i] > 0 means there will be rains over the rains[i] lake.</li>
<li>rains[i] == 0 means there are no rains this day and you choose <b>one lake</b> this day and dry it</li></ul><br>

Return an array ans where: <br><ul>
  <li> ans.length == rains.length</li>
  <li> ans[i] == -1 if rains[i] >0 </li>
  <li> ans[i] is the lake you choose to dry in the ith day if rains[i] == 0 </li></ul><br>

If there are multiple valid answers return any of them. If it is impossible to avoid floods return <b>an empty array</b>
Notice that if you chose to dry a full lake, it becomes empty, but if you chose to dry an empty lake, nothing changes.

<b>Example 1:</b><br>
<b>Input:</b> rains = [1, 2, 3, 4] <br>
<b>Output:</b> [-1, -1, -1, -1] <br>
<b>Explanation:</b> After the first day full lakes are [1] <br>
After the second day full lakes are [1, 2] <br>
After the third day full lakes are [1, 2, 3] <br>
After the fourth day full lakes are [1, 2, 3, 4] <br>
There's no day to dry any lake and there is no flood in any lake <br>

<b>Example 2:</b><br>
<b>Input:</b> rains = [1, 2, 0, 0, 2, 1] <br>
<b>Output:</b>  [-1, -1, 2, 1, -1, -1] <br>
<b>Explanation</b>: After the first day full lakes are [1] <br>
After the second day full lakes are [1, 2] <br>
After the third day we dry lake 2. Full lakes are [1] <br>
After the fourth day we dry lake 1. There is no full lakes. <br>
After the fifth day, full lakes are [2]. <br>
After the sixth day, full lakes are [1, 2]. <br>
It is easy to that this scenario is flood-free. [-1, -1, 1, 2, -1, -1] is another acceptable scenario. <br>

<b>Example 3:</b> <br>
<b>Input:</b> rains = [1, 2, 0, 1, 2] <br>
<b>Output:</b> [] <br>
<b>Explanation</b>: After the second day, full lakes are [1, 2]. We have to dry one lake on the third day. After that, it will rain over lakes [1, 2]. It's easy to prove that no matter which lake you choose to dry in the 3rd day, the other one will flood.

<b>Constraints:</b><br>
<ul><li> 1 <= rains.length <= 10<sup>5</sup> </li>
  <li> 0<=rains[i] <= 10<sup>9</sup></li>

The <b>pair sum</b> of a pair (a, b) is equal to a+b. The maximum pair sum is the largest pair sum in a list of pairs. <br>

For example, if we have pairs (1, 5), (2, 3) and (4, 4), the maximum pair sum would be max(1+5, 2+3, 4+4) = max (6, 5, 8) = 8 <br>

Given an array nums of even length n, pair up the elements of nums into n/2 pairs such that
<ul><li>Each element of nums is in <b>exactly one</b> pair</li>
  <li> The <b>maximum pair sum</b> is <b>minimized</b></li></ul><br><br>
  
Return the minimized <b>maximum pair sum</b> after optimally pairing up the elements.

<b>Example 1:</b> <br>
<b>Input:</b> nums = [3, 5, 2, 3] <br>
<b>Output:</b> 7 <br>
<b>Explanation:</b> The elements can be paired up into pairs (3, 3) and (5, 2). The maximum pair sum is max(3+3, 5+2) = max(6, 7) = 7.<br>


<b>Example 2:</b> <br>
<b>Input:</b> nums = [3, 5, 4, 2, 4, 6] <br>
<b>Output:</b> 8 <br>
<b>Explanation:</b> The elements can be paired up into pairs (3, 5), (4, 4) and (6, 2). The maximum pair sum is max(3+5, 4+4, 6+2) = max(8, 8, 8) = 8.<br>

A <b>critical point</b> in a linked list is defined as <b>either</b> a <b>local maxima</b> or a <b>local minima.</b>
A node is a <b>local maxima</b> if the current node has a value <b>strictly greater</b> than the previous node and the next node. <br>

A node is a <b>local minima</b> if the current node has a value <b>strictly smaller</b> than the previous node and the next node. <br>

Note that a node can only be a local maxima/minima if there exists <b>both</b> a previous node and a next node. <br>

Given a linkedlist head, return an array of length 2 containing [minDistance, maxDistance] where minDistance is the <b>minimum distance</b> between <b>any two distinct</b> critical points and maxDistance is the <b>maximum distance</b> between <b>any two distinct</b> critical points. If there are fewer than two critical points, return [-1, -1]. <br>

<b>Example 1:</b> <br>
<b>Input:</b> head = [3, 1] <br>

<b>Explanation:</b> There are no critical points in [3, 1]<br><br>

<b>Example 2:</b> <br>
<b>Input:</b> head = [5, 3, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2] <br>
<b>Output:</b> [1, 3] <br>
<b>Explanation:</b> There are three critical points:<br>
-[5, 3, <b>1</b>, 2, 5, 1, 2]: The third node is a local minima because 1 is less than 3 and 2<br>

Given a string word, return the sum of the number of vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o' and 'u') in every substring of word
A substring is a contiguous (non-empty) sequence of characters within a string. <br>

Note: Due to the large constraints, the answer may not fit in a signed 32 bit integer. Please be careful during the calculations.

<b>Example 1:</b> <br>
<b>Input:</b> word = "aba" <br>
<b>Output:</b> 6 <br>
<b>Exaplanation:</b> All possible substrings are "a", "ab", "aba", "b", "ba", and "a". <br>
"b" has 0 vowels in it <br>
"a", "ab", "ba" and "a" have 1 vowel each <br>
"aba" has 2 vowels in it <br>

You are given a <b>0-indexed</b> integer array mapping which represents the mapping rule of a shuffled decimal system. mapping[i] = j means digit i should be mapped to digit j in this system.<br>

The <b>mapped value</b> of an integer is the new integer obtained by replacing each occurence of digit i in the integer with mapping[i] for all 0 <= i <= 9. <br>

You are also given anoter integer array nums. Return the array nums sorted in non-decreasing order based on the mapped values of its elements. <br>

<b>Notes:</b>
<ul><li>Elements with the same mapped values should appear in the <b>same relative order</b> as in the input</li>
  <li> The elements of nums should only be sorted based on their mapped values and <b>not be replaced</b> by them.</li></ul>

<b>Example 1:</b> <br>
<b>Input:</b> mapping = [8, 9, 4, 0, 2, 1, 3, 5, 7, 6], nums = [991, 338, 38] <br>
<b>Output:</b> [338, 38, 991] <br>
<b>Explanation:</b> <br>
Map the number 991 as follows: <br>
1. Mapping[9] = 6, so all occurences of the digit 9 will become 6. <br>
2. Mapping[1] = 9, so all occurences of the digit 1 will become 9. <br>
Therefore, the mapped value of 991 is 669. 338 maps to 007, or 7, which is also 7 after removing the leading zeros. <br>
38 maps to 07, which is also 7 after removing leading zeros. Since 338 and 38 share the same mapped value, they should remain in the same relative order, so 338 comes before 38. <br>
Thus, the sorted array is [338, 38, 991]. <br>

Note that there may be other ways to increment nums to have the maximum product <br>

<b>Example 2:</b><br>
<b>Input:</b> nums = [6, 3, 3, 2], k = 2 <br>
<b>Output:</b> 216 <br>
<b>Explanation:</b> Increment the second number 1 time and increment the fourth number 1 time.
Now nums =[6, 4, 3, 3], with a product of 6*4*3*3 = 216 <br>
It can be shown that 216 is maximum product

<b>Constraints:</b><br>
<ul><li> 1 <= nums.length, k <=10<sup>5</sup></li>
  <li> 0 <= nums[i] <=10<sup>6</sup></li></ul>

<a id = "problem2240"> 2240. Number of Ways to Buy Pens and Pencils (Medium) </a> <br><br>

You are given an integer total indicating the total amount of money you have. You are also given two integers cost1 and cost2 indicating the price of a pen and pencil respectively. You can spend part or all of your money to buy multiple quantities (or none) of each kind of writing utensil.<br>
  
Return the number of distinct ways you can buy some number of pens and pencils.<br>
  
<b>Example 1:</b><br>
<b>Input:</b> total = 20, cost1 = 10, cost2 = 5<br>
Output: 9<br>
Explanation: The price of a pen is 10 and the price of a pencil is 5.<br>
-If you buy 0 pens, you can buy 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 pencils<br>
-If you buy 1 pen, you can buy 0, 1 or 2 pencils<br>
-If you buy 2 pens, you can not buy any pencils.<br>
 The total number of ways to buy pens and pencils is 5+3+1 = 9<br>
  
Example 2: <br>
Input: total = 5, cost1 = 10, cost2 = 10 <br>
Output: 1 <br>
Explanation: The price of both pens and pencils are 10, which cost more than total, so you cannot buy any writing utensils. Therefore, there is only one way: buy 0 pens and 0 pencils<br>
  
<b>Constraints:</b><br>
  <ul><li> 1 <= total, cost1, cost2 <= 10<sup>6</sup></li></ul>

-In the second round, you complete 2 tasks of difficulty level 3 <br>
-In the third round, you complete 3 tasks of difficulty level 4 <br>
-In the fourth round, you complete 2 tasks of difficulty level 4 <br>
It can be shown that all the tasks cannot be completed in fewer than 4 rounds, so the answer is 4 <br>

<b>Example 2:</b><br>
<b>Input:</b> tasks = [2, 3, 3] <br>
<b>Output:</b> -1 <br>
<b>Explanation:</b> There is only 1 task of difficulty level 2, but in each round, you can only complete either
