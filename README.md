# Leetcode
In this repository I solve some of the problems on Leetcode 

29. Given two integers dividend and divisor divide two integers without using multiplication, division and mod operator
The integer division should truncate toward zero, which means losing its fractional part.

Example 1:
Input: dividend = 10, divisor = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: 10/3 = 3.3333 which is truncated to 3.

Example 2:
Input: dividend = 7, divisor = -3
Output: -2
Explanation: 7/-3 = -2.3333 which is truncated to -2.

Constraints:
-2^31 <= dividend, divisor <= 2^31 -1
divisor != 0
